# Reaction-Diff-Eq-RK4-Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation for solving a system of differential equations for a given group of reactions. The task involves developing a system of differential equations, choosing initial conditions within the range (0,1), and solving it using the Runge-Kutta 4th order (RK4) method. The reaction rates are expected to be in the interval [0,2], and the results are visualized by plotting graphs of the variation of all concentrations on a single sheet of paper.

## Introduction

In this project, we have implemented a Python script (`src.py`) that allows you to define a set of chemical reactions and solve the corresponding system of differential equations. You can choose your own initial conditions for concentrations (within the range 0 to 1) and visualize the results by plotting concentration variations.

## Requirements

To run the `src.py` script, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy: A Python library for numerical computations
- Matplotlib: A Python library for creating visualizations

## Running the program
```
python src.py
```
